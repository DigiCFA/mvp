# How to run 

Prerequisite: make sure Expo is properly setup. https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/

1. 
```
cd mvp/FrontEnd
npx expo start
```

2. Open the Mac Simulator (download from XCode). So far design has been modelled on iPhone 14 ios 16.4.

3. **'i'** to open in the ios simulator. Can also choose to scan the code and open on your personal device. Recommended pinning the simulator window during development.

4. **'r'** to refresh. Can do this on both simulator or terminal window.
   
5. Might need to restart server every once in a while. Patience is key.

- Have not tried on Andriod - requires downloading Andriod Studio.
  
- If running multiple simulators, go to the Expo Go App home menu and copy in the >exp:// URL manually.
  
- Can also choose to open on Web. For debugging, press **'j'**. By default the debugger opens in a Chrome window. (Can also set up VSCode React Debugger but that is slightly more complicated)
